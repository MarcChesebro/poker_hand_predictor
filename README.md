# poker_hand_predictor
A simple implementation of a small neural network to predict poker hands. This is mostly just an example of how to use keras on multi-class classification problems.

# Creating a new model
```
python poker_hand.py
```

# Using model
once the model is created you can use the PokerHandPredictor class to interact with it and predict poker hands.
